  <h2>Yale Systems Biology Institute – Farren Isaacs Lab</h2>

    <strong>B.S./M.S. Researcher</strong> &mdash; January 2024 – Present, New Haven, CT

  <p>
    As a full and part-time researcher in the <a href="https://isaacslab.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Farren Isaacs Lab</a>, I have been at the forefront of developing innovative genomic diversification technologies. My work centers on harnessing multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) and MOSAIC (multiplex one-step SSAP-mediated plasmid diversification protocol) to systematically explore and expand the genetic potential of non-model microbes. This research has required designing and implementing complex experimental protocols, troubleshooting new methodologies, and analyzing large datasets to determine the optimal machinery necessary for large-scale genomic diversification with applications in metabolic engineering and biochemical pathway optimization. One of the most rewarding aspects of this role has been presenting my progress at the 2024 Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Innovation, and Design (SEED) conference, where I engaged with leaders in the field and received valuable feedback that has shaped the direction of my work. Through this experience, I have honed my skills in experimental design, data analysis, and scientific communication, and have developed a deep appreciation for the collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of modern synthetic biology.

  <h2>ETH Zürich – Randall Platt Group</h2>

    <strong>Project Mobility Student</strong> &mdash; May 2023 – August 2023, Basel, Switzerland
  </div>
  <p>
    My summer at ETH Zürich as a project mobility student in <a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/platt" target="_blank">Randall Platt's group</a> was a transformative experience that immersed me in international, cutting-edge research. I contributed to the optimization of an <em>in vivo</em> selection system for CRISPR-mediated spacer acquisition from RNA <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0569-1" target="_blank">(Record-seq)</a>, a technology that enables cells to record transcriptional events as a form of genetic memory. My responsibilities spanned the design and execution of experiments with diverse promoter sequences and ribosome binding site (RBS) acquisition assays, leveraging both two-plasmid and one-plasmid systems. I also performed comprehensive analyses of next-generation sequencing data, extracting meaningful insights to identify protospacer sequences and improve the efficiency and fidelity of CRISPR spacer acquisition. This experience not only deepened my technical expertise in molecular biology and bioinformatics, but also exposed me to the collaborative spirit and rigor of European research environments.

    <strong>STARS Summer Researcher</strong> &mdash; May 2022 – August 2022, New Haven, CT

  <p>
    As a STARS I Summer researcher, I was privileged to work at the intersection of synthetic biology, biological engineering, and women's health as a member of the Yale iGEM team and collaborating with the Farren Isaacs Lab. Our project aimed to address the detrimental impacts of traditional, estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy through the design and implementation of novel biological systems to produce a phytoestrogen called equol. In this project, I played a central role in both experimental work and the development of outreach initiatives. This experience involved close collaboration with more than 15 international teams and institutions, fostering a global network of young scientists committed to advancing synthetic biology. The culmination of our efforts was the presentation of our work at the 2022 iGEM Grand Jamboree in Paris, where our team was awarded a silver medal for research excellence, scientific communication, and effective teamwork. This project not only strengthened my technical and collaborative skills, but also reinforced my passion for using science as a tool for positive societal impact.
