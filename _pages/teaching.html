    <strong>August 2023 – December 2024, New Haven, CT</strong>
  </div>
  <p>
    As an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for “Biology at the Molecular Level,” I played a pivotal role in cultivating an engaging, inclusive, and supportive classroom environment for Yale undergraduates exploring the intersection of biology and physics. I facilitated interactive discussions, clarified complex biophysical concepts, and encouraged active student participation. My responsibilities extended beyond traditional teaching duties—I collaborated with faculty to adapt instructional strategies, provided one-on-one support to students, and helped implement inclusive pedagogical practices. This experience deepened my appreciation for mentorship and reinforced my commitment to fostering a collaborative and equitable learning environment in STEM.

  <h2>STARS I Peer Mentor, Yale University</h2>
  <div>
    <strong>August 2023 – May 2024, New Haven, CT</strong>
  </div>
  <p>
    As a Peer Mentor for the Science, Technology, and Research Scholars <a href = "https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/stem-fellowships/funding-stem-opportunities-yale/stars/stars-i-academic-year-program" target="blank">(STARS) I </a>program, I guided and empowered first-year Yale undergraduates from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds as they transitioned into STEM disciplines. I provided personalized academic support and advising, fostered a sense of community, and worked closely with upper administration to promote equity and inclusion in STEM education. By sharing my own experiences and offering practical advice, I helped mentees navigate academic challenges, build confidence, and develop a strong foundation for success in their scientific careers. This role was especially meaningful to me, as it allowed me to contribute directly to increasing diversity and representation in science.

  <h2>Founder & Inaugural President, Yale ASBMB Student Chapter</h2>
  <div>
    <strong>2024 – Present, New Haven, CT</strong>
  </div>
  <p>
    As the founder and inaugural president of <a href = "https://campuspress.yale.edu/asbmbatyale/" target="blank">Yale’s undergraduate student chapter</a> of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology <a href="https://www.asbmb.org/" target="blank">(ASBMB)</a>, I established a vibrant student organization dedicated to fostering scientific community, professional development, and outreach in the molecular biosciences. I recruited a diverse executive board, set the chapter’s mission, wrote the constitution, and organized events to connect undergraduate students and faculty. Through seminars, workshops, and outreach initiatives, our chapter will provide a platform for students to engage with cutting-edge research, attend national conferences, develop essential skills, and participate in science outreach. I am proud to have laid the foundation for an inclusive and collaborative community that will support Yale’s molecular biosciences students for years to come.

  <h2>Effective Secondary STEM Teaching Coursework & Classroom Experience</h2>
  <div>
    <strong>Yale University, 2025</strong>
  </div>
  <p>
    In addition to my formal teaching roles, I completed a course on Effective Secondary STEM Teaching, where I explored the principles of pedagogy, anti-racist and anti-eugenics curriculum design, and classroom management. As part of this course, I shadowed a New Haven Public School chemistry teacher, gaining firsthand insight into the daily realities and challenges of secondary science education. This immersive experience culminated in my planning and delivering a chemistry lesson to high school students, allowing me to apply evidence-based teaching strategies and adapt my communication for a younger audience. This experience not only strengthened my understanding of effective STEM pedagogy but also reinforced my dedication to science outreach and education at all levels.
