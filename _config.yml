title: David A. McElfresh<br><h4>Synthetic Biologist | Incoming Princeton PhD Student</h4>
description: I am a synthetic biologist completing my BS/MS in Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry at Yale University, where I have focused on synthetic biology approaches to engineer the genomes of non-model microbes. My interests include designing and leveraging genome editing tools to address challenges in carbon capture biotechnology. This fall, I will join Princeton University as a graduate student in Molecular Biology to further explore innovative solutions at the intersection of synthetic biology and the environment.
